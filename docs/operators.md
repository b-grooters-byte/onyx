Onyx supports a set of arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operators. Operators 
in Onyx are not overloadable.

 Operator | Example | Explanation |
----------|---------|------------
! | !expr | Bitwise or logical complement 
!= | expr != expr | Nonequality comparison
% | expr % expr | Arithmetic remainder
%= | var %= expr | Arithmetic remainder and assignment
& | expr & expr | Bitwise AND
&= | var &= expr | Bitwise AND and assignment
&& | expr && expr | Short-circuiting logical AND
\* | expr * expr | Arithmetic multiplication
*= | var *= expr | Arithmetic multiplication and assignment
\+ | expr + expr | Arithmetic addition
+= | var += expr | Arithmetic addition and assignment
, | expr, expr | Argument and element separator
\- | expr - expr | Arithmetic subtraction
-= | var  expr | Arithmetic subtraction and assignment
/ | expr / expr	| Arithmetic division
/= |var /= expr | Arithmetic division and assignment
; | expr; | Statement terminator
< | expr < expr | Less than comparison
<= | expr <= expr | Less than or equal comparison
= | var = expr | Assignment
== | expr == expr | Equality comparison
\> | expr > expr | Greater than comparison
\>= | expr >= expr | Greater than or equal comparison
\| | expr \| expr | Bitwise OR
\|= | var \|= expr | Bitwise OR and assignment
\|\| | expr \|\| expr | Short-circuiting logical OR
